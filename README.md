# tidy_tested_safe
Tidy, Tested, Safe  training materials.

This repo is deliberately very thin. 

The `tts_scnd_course_files` directory has the all the files you need to build the 6 releases
of the `tts_scnd` package. This is the coursework for the Tidy Tested Safe course. 

To follow the Tidy Tested Safe course, just read the **Tidy_Tested_Safe_Book.pdf** file in this repo.

A partial guide to various repos in the [ticdat](https://github.com/ticdat) **organization**  are as follows.

* `ticdat` This is the repo for development of the `ticdat` [package](https://pypi.org/project/ticdat/)
* `tidy_tested_safe` A largely code-free repo that holds the "Tidy Tested Safe" 
[wiki](https://github.com/ticdat/tidy_tested_safe/wiki) and coursework sample files.
* `tts_diet` A [demonstration](https://github.com/ticdat/tts_diet) of the standard diet example hosted as a 
"Tidy Tested Safe" repo.
* `tts_netflow_a`  A [demonstration](https://github.com/ticdat/tts_netflow_a) of the multi-commodity network
flow problem developed as a "Tidy Tested Safe" repo. The problem is developed incrementally to demonstrate 
an Agile workflow. The first release tag solves the simpler, one commodity problem. This release bootstraps the 
solution to the multi-commodity problem.
* `tts_netflow_b`  Similar to `tts_netflow_a`. [Demonstrates](https://github.com/ticdat/tts_netflow_b) a pipeline to 
munge the data into a more mathematical format, and introduces optimization code only in the third release tag.
