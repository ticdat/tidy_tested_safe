# tidy_tested_safe
Tidy, Tested, Safe  training materials.

This repo is deliberately very thin. Mostly it will contain wiki pages. 

The guide to all the repos in the ticdat organization are as follows.

* `ticdat` This is the repo for development of the `ticdat` [package](https://pypi.org/project/ticdat/)
* `tidy_tested_safe` A largely code-free repo that holds the "Tidy Tested Safe" 
[wiki](https://github.com/ticdat/tidy_tested_safe/wiki).
* `tts_diet` A [demonstration](https://github.com/ticdat/tts_diet) of the standard diet example hosted as a 
"Tidy Tested Safe" repo.
* `tts_netflow_a`  A [demonstration](https://github.com/ticdat/tts_netflow_a) of the multi-commodity network
flow problem developed as a "Tidy Tested Safe" repo. The problem is developed incrementally to demonstrate 
an Agile workflow. The first release tag solves the simpler, one commodity problem. This release bootstraps the 
solution to the multi-commodity problem.
* `tts_netflow_b`  Similar to `tts_netflow_a`. [Demonstrates](https://github.com/ticdat/tts_netflow_b) a pipeline to 
munge the data into a more mathematical format, and introduces optimization code only in the third release tag.
