## Tidy Tested Safe Coursework Files

If you are a Python beginner, then start with the `python_beginner_notebook_exercises` directory.
This directory provides sample data as csv files, and two partially completed notebooks. Your goal here is 
to complete the two notebooks. 

The remainder of the Tidy Tested Safe course requires you to build a `tts_scnd` package. The entire course requires
you to complete 6 releases of this package. The sixth release is the most difficult and is not needed to demonstrate
your ability to write "industrial code". The materials for each of these releases is in directories
`release_0_0_1` through `release_0_0_6`.
