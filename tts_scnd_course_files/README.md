## Tidy Tested Safe Coursework Files

The Tidy Tested Safe course requires you to build a `tts_scnd` package. The entire course requires
you to complete 6 releases of this package. The sixth release is the most difficult. Releases 0.0.1 through
0.0.5 are a reasonable goal for a less strenuous course.
